# Commit Message Guidelines

## Structure
1. **Header**: A short summary of the changes (50 characters or less).
2. **Body** (optional): Detailed explanation of the changes, if necessary.
3. **Footer** (optional): References to issues or tasks, if applicable.

## Best Practices
- **Use the imperative mood**: E.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug".
- **Be concise but descriptive**: Summarize what the commit does.
- **Separate subject from body with a blank line**: If you need a detailed explanation, add it in the body.
- **Limit the header to 50 characters**: Keep it short and to the point.
- **Wrap the body at 72 characters**: For better readability.
- **Use the body to explain what and why, not how**: Focus on the reasons behind the changes.

By following these guidelines, we ensure our commit history is clean, readable, and useful for everyone on the team.

Happy coding!
