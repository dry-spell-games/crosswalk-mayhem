# 🚸 Crosswalk Mayhem

## 📝 Description

**Crosswalk Mayhem** is a retro-inspired, single-screen mobile action game where your mission is to help pedestrians safely cross a busy street.

🧠💥 **Put your reflexes to the test!** Tap to stop pedestrians at just the right time, or double-tap to make them sprint past oncoming traffic. Watch out for wandering elders with wandering minds — and reckless drivers who have no regard for pedestrian safety.
